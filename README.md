# Parking Lot


## Pre requisites

The source code for this project is written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer before running this application, **if not please install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**.

To check if you have Node.js and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

 - **Test Node.js**: To see if Node is installed, type `node -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this `v10.16.0`.

 - **Test NPM**. To see if NPM is installed, type `npm -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this `6.9.0`.

> **Note:** [Node installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installs both Node.js and npm on your system.
